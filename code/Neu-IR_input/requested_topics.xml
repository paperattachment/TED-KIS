			<paragraph>I remember the speaker said the intransparency of the salary lead to information asymmetry,and some famous people has doubt the prohibition of the right to talk about the salary, and do some things against it.According to the statistics, a large amount of people think they are underpaid. By comparing the  salary, people would work harder and increase the work efficiency.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It's a speech about thinking ahead to avoid bad things or minimize the damage of those things. At the beginning, the speaker told a experience. He forgot to take the key when he would take a plane. so he had to break the window and crawl into the house. But at last , he hadn't taken his passport when arriving airport.Then he told us about how to deal with such things. Maybe the best way is to think ahead, put all the things in fixed place or install some alternative system. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>The TED talk is done by a man. He begins by talking about a book about street magic (in India I think) which he quotes. He says how the author of the book would have people come up to him after a show and swear he's done this or that when he hasn't, he's just done magic tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quote is something to the tune of: &quot;Real magic is the only kind of magic that isn't real. If it can be explained by a trick, it's not real magic.&quot;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I know that's not a lot to go off of by I've searched a long time for this and have had no luck. Any thoughts would be helpful!</paragraph>

			<paragraph>He said he helped found the mental health special interest alumni group at my college. And it is so touching that he mentioned that being honest about how we feel does not make us weak; it makes us human. And depressive people need to stop suffering in silence. This talk is so touching. Please give me the link if you can find this talk. Thanks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph> I remember that in the beginning of this talk there are two dancers and a fellow dancer danced with each other. The two men mentioned that classic Latin and ballroom dancing is not just a system of dancing, but a way of thinking, being, relating each other. Tango, waltz, foxtrot ... these classic ballroom dances quietly perpetuate an outdated idea: that the man always leads and the woman always follows. Then they demonstrated their &quot;Liquid Lead&quot; dance technique which was quite interesting to me. If you find this talk, tell me I'm not dreaming this up. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>Perhaps I invented this Ted talk out of thin air, because I cannot seem to find it despite looking for two days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am looking for the talk about Gmo foods, where the speaker gives accounts about how the genes they are replacing cannot harm humans. It is not &quot;The case for engineering our food&quot; talk as I have watched this twice to make sure it was not the same one that I am thinking of.</paragraph>

We now know that these receptors are found all over the body, including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle, in kidneys, lungs and blood vessels.

			<paragraph>it was a female kinda consultant specialist. She talks about how we as a species cling to narratives. An example would be her explanation as to why the &quot;hero's story&quot; is so prevalent and widely used. She also gives examples, one being Steve Jobs' first iPhone keynote and another being (I think) the Obama '08 campaign. With the Apple and Obama examples, she discusses how unsatisfactory their respective industries are and how they stress how everything would change under them. I remember one specific part where she uses a line graph to discuss the beats Steve Jobs used in the keynote. The biggest high note being the phone responding seamlessly to his touch. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>Something about how arranging 0-9 in a star shape is the same format as DNA and has the secrets to solving cancer along with damn near every other disease. He name drops a lot of incoherent jargon like saying that dark energy is the same thing as tachyons. He said he based his research off some old mathematician or something who said he'd be the only person to ever understand it, the speaker then says he must be his reincarnation because he does. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>She mentioned that If you're trying to CRISPR a genome, the first thing that you have to do is damage the DNA. And the part that's amazing about it is that the guide RNA, only 20 letters of it, are what target the system. This is really easy to design, and it's really cheap to buy. So that's the part that is modular in the system; everything else stays the same. This makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The speaker was a young boy in Peru, a story given by his grandfather was repeated in the talk: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it. Twelve years later, after training as a geoscientist, he set out on a journey deep into the jungle of South America in search of this boiling river. At a time when everything seems mapped and measured, join Ruzo as he explores a river that forces us to question the line between known and unknown and reminds us that there are great wonders yet to be discovered.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I just saw maybe half of this talk. I really don’t know. Sociologists like this speaker have long explained that race is a social construction. When they identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, they're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar, he has also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races. Those are all of my memories, if you recognize this, tell me please.</paragraph>

A woman zoologist, whose name I have forgot, encourages us to rethink common attitudes toward bats, whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic makeup. It seems to describe a lot of things about bat in this video.</paragraph>

Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I watched a Ted Talks 4 years ago (2012) about the brain. The speaker was a man who showed brain scans of people before and after they changed their diets. He showed his own too. The brains of people who drank more alcohol and consumed sugar had far more craters and holes. At one point he talks about going to his church to talk about healthy living and finds that they're giving away free donuts. I can't find the talk anywhere! What is this Ted Talks?</paragraph>

The refugees are also human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, so they have the ability to make contributions.

			<paragraph>I only remember that the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution. So seductive was this idea, so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something, that it really swept through biology. It was a transformation like no other. And people have really spent the last 100 years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases, in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It was a TED Talk I heard a while back. It was about the beginning of life in the universe. It talked about how a random set of circumstances could occur in one area that make chances of life greater. Then within that area it could happen again. So on and so forth. It was hands down my favorite TED talk, and I cant seem to find it for the life of me. PLEASE, if anyone knows which one I am talking about, can you please point me in the right direction?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A video about the development branch of the language, a few minutes, a female voice, English, totally animated demo. I remember that the language can be traced back to a very few kinds of languages, The branches of the language are due to migrations in different tribes to other places for the fertile soil and food. because of the different weather conditions and environmental factors in various places, the differences get more and more; There are so many languages ​​nowadays, So it is hard to say a language develops from a language, and it is harder to trace backwards (with animation: a woman in a skirt Jumping to the language branches, jumping, suddenly fell down, because the more difficult to trace back to the language), while no one knows a language tree will develop into what kind for stop, so the current language type is about 3000 to 8,000 kinds. Finally, he said that there is only one language in Chinese. However, there are many dialects with great differences. However, They can understand each other, just as the Spanish and the Portuguese can also understand each other So, in conclusion, when you hear a strange language, do not be nervous because that language may be very close to your own language. At the beginning also mentioned the story of Babel. If you can find the video, it is really grateful, thank you!</paragraph>

It's most likely a Ted talk but it could be from U22 or Planet Money or This American Life, not sure. But anyway it was about an accountability group in NYC that changed it's defeatist mindset and turned itself into a success group instead.Their first project was to get the creepy dude in their group a date.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Basically, I remember this incredible story about a man who must have been some sort of orientation rep for a university. On the first day, he goes up to an anxious girl and has a short conversation with her. He then introduces her to the guy behind her in the line and then leaves. A few years later, it's one of his last days in university when the girl (who he didn't recognize) comes up to him. She says that he has changed her life. She was about to drop out that day, but she decided to move on because he was so friendly. Also, the guy he introduced her to is now her boyfriend. They eventually got married, and he went to their wedding.</paragraph>

Then he talked about doing the same thing to a random girl but at first he was too scared. He also talked about how he wanted to take a picture of a black guy on the street but they weren't friends so he didn't let him at first until they had a long conversation and became friends.</paragraph>

The rest of my memories regarding this might or might not be correct: the guy was sitting on a chair. He had a calm, soothing voice  (think Mike Birbiglia). The talk might have been included in a documentary of some sort, and I might have seen it on netflix. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>This speaker tell some stories about her disability. After these stories, she wants to offer you a new perspective. She wants to challenge the idea that design is but a tool to create function and beauty. Design greatly impacts upon people's lives, all lives. Design is a way in which we can feel included in the world, but it is also a way in which we can uphold a person's dignity and their human rights. Please give me the link if you can find this talk.

So as you can see, lying is really a typical part of development. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>He mentioned that with this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world. Robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better. Technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. Can anyone tell me everything about this talk? Or just give me a link?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The speaker is a 60s woman. She introduces 12 truths she learned from life. And she begins this talk with somethings about her grandchildren. I remember the first one is that all truth is a paradox. In this video many people laughs because of her words. And this video is about 15 minutes. She says today many people feel terrible and they can’t believe things in this world.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I'm trying to find a video on TED, but I don't remember the name of it. It was about certain patterns that would show up in various places. One example was in how leaves are grown and another was an African village that also made use of the same pattern. Something about how complicated things in nature are built by using simple structures again and again to make complex larger structures. It may have been about evolution at some level. </paragraph>

			<paragraph>The speaker talked about that we tend not to think about the air that much at all. We notice it mostly when there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it, like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist. But it's always there. It's touching all of us right now. It's even inside us. Our air is immediate, vital and intimate. And yet, it's so easily forgotten. Please give me the link if you can find this talk.

			<paragraph>Hey folks, I've been trying to locate an old TED talk for a while now, and no matter what I search I can't pull it up. The central question was, 'what are the odds that everything you believe is true?' The speaker talked about establishing a likelihood for the truth of ideas. Maybe I believe man made global warming has an 85% chance of being true, but Keynesian economics only has a 55% chance of being true. He made comparisons to poker, and joked about the likelihood his TED talk was true.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I only saw about 3 minutes of this talk. I remember the speakers said that as we get older, diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. When neurons die, the brain starts to shrink, and there's an increased susceptibility for these and he talked about neurodegenerative diseases. I don’t know, somebody help me to find out the link of this talk, please~</paragraph>

It was a TED talk in which a young man presented a fictional scenario based on real events in order to illustrate the speed and reach of social media.  The story he told was of a woman who posted a video of herself singing a song, which then went viral, and ended in a riot in front of her house and her death.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So the guy moved to the city and busted his ass to make enough money to pay for accommodation and a meal at the end of the day, and then realized that it wasn't the way he wanted to live.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>He mentions spending a weeks (or something like that) wages to buy some jeans, and how ridiculous it was in hindsight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I like a part when he says some people he knows are working in the city to buy a home in 15 years and he built a home in a few weeks/months working a few hours a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Towards the end he mentions he doesn't buy clothes and because of this when friends came around they used to say stuff like &quot;you're always wearing the same clothes.&quot; and then they give him their old clothes, then he jokes about having to much clothing friends have donated.</paragraph>

He said there's no single formula for a great talk, but all the best talks have one thing in common. These speakers are sharing their ideas with audiences, which is the kernel of the TED talks. He also gives some examples to explain what is the meaning of the ideas.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I remember the speaker asks audiences what is going on inside the brains of animals at the beggining? He think we should pay more attention on the animals viewed with animals' eyes. He uses discoveries that span ecology, biology and behavioral science, gives examples of whales, wolves, elephants and albatrosses to argue that the animals can think, feel, use tools and express emotions. I think that's a interesting way to understand other creatures. I want to share it to my friends, but I can't find it.</paragraph>

The importance of democracy does not lie in its own &quot;good&quot; nor is it the benefit that it can bring Democracy is that it embodies the legitimacy of the law.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I can't remember the title, but the speaker was a man. He spoke about the difference in psychology between people in the past and people today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most memorable comparison he made was that people in the past were essentially incapable of perspective empathy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you asked someone 'back then' who was racist how they would feel if they were the black person they hated, their response would be, &quot;But I'm not black.&quot; If you asked them what they would feel if they went to sleep and woke up black, their response would be something like &quot;But that's impossible. That's never happened in the history of mankind.&quot;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In short, they were incapable of grasping these types of hypothetical situations.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>She mentioned that treating PMS has become a profitable, thriving industry. And the good news about PMS is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle, the great majority don't get a mental disorder. They go to work or school, take care of their families, and function at a normal level. Those are all of my memories, if you recognize this, tell me please.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I remember this video going around Reddit some time back, where the speaker (who had some particular creative industry job, like an architect or something a rather) would leave or quit his job every so often, say every 5-10 years or so, in order to recoup his creativity by taking a year off work. I specifically remember him going to Indonesia or similar in one of the latest work leave trips he's done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This TED talk came up during a conversation with a friend the other day, and I've been endeavouring to dig it up ever since. The talk really strikes a tone with me, and gives me an idea of what I should do in order to keep up my ability within the creative industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tell me I'm not dreaming this up.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It's a TED talk about how to get things done, accomplishments, large scale works... It's at least a year or two old, and I remember one bit in particular about how you're not supposed to tell people about what you're working on, because that deceives your brain into thinking you've already gotten something done and it relieves you of doing actual work. (Or something to that effect.)</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Can't remember the actual topic, but it was something to do with how humans value art. There was a bit where he (it was definitely a guy, white, middle aged) talked about how people generally care more about the history, price, status of a piece of art rather than what the actual art is. Quite a while back, definitely more than 3 years ago I'd say. Pretty sure it was a TED talk and not TEDx or anything else.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>This video is about a man musician how to fight with the stage fright. The speaker talks about humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear. Obviously the sense is less wonderful when that the visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of music or dance fans in front of stage. The video told us how to conquer stage fright like palms sweat, hands shake, vision blurs.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>She mentioned that design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving. There are five steps. The first is defining the problem and understanding its constraints. The second is observing people in real-life situations and empathizing with them. Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas -- the more the better,the wilder the better. And I forget the rest of steps. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The video was of an African American gentleman who served in the US army during Jim Crowe segregation, before the civil rights act provided protections in public Accommodations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>He discusses how when he went to a new base, one of his first orders of business was trying to find an apartment. The base had several landlords they worked with, and all were keen on his business. Until he showed up. Then suddenly none had any rooms available. He ended up having to find a place well over an hour off base to live.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>He continues on about when he had to transfer bases, how hotels would have vacancy signs on, but when he would ask for a room they'd say they forgot to turn the sign off until he left, and then in the rearview he'd see the sign flip back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Specifically I need this for an ongoing discussion about human rights and the reason behind protecting classes of people in public accommodations.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>I can't remember that much but I believe it was a female speaker who lived in an artificial &quot;bubble&quot; with a few other scientists, where they had to live in complete austerity for a few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most vivid thing I remember was that they used their own feces (or was it just compost?) to fertilize their crop which in turn they ate etc (and turned the leftovers into compost?). After a while of this cycle, the crop changed colour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When they finished the experiment, they remarked that the people outside stank because of the mixture of all the body products such as parfume, shampoo, etc.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>They make a lot famous music videos. And the first part of this talk is one of their famous videos. They said that the videos are not all Rube Goldberg machines. For one of the videos, they choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo, and then filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air. Can anyone tell me everything about this talk? Or just give me a link?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Owing to my memory, i only remember some piece of sentences. She shares news of a serendipitous breakthrough treatment that may prevent mental disorders like depression and PTSD from ever developing. Functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us. It's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function. And mental set is another thing. I really need this talk. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations, so the usual physics approach doesn't really work here.What looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction.Networks are ideal representations of complex systems.A high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability, because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The speaker talked about that economist Michael Porter described what's going on here best. Many decades ago, he said that it's most beneficial for a country to focus on producing the products it can produce most efficiently and trading for the rest. So what he's talking about here is shared production, and efficiency is the name of the game. You've probably seen an example of this at home or at work. Those are all of my memories, if you recognize this, tell me please.</paragraph>

And fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question than middle-aged people, and younger people as well. And a recent Gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day. And stress and anger all decrease with age. If you recognize this talk.

			<paragraph>Have sex with no one other. I remember  this clearly. The more willing a husband is to do housework the more attractive his wife will find him. The one who smiles in his childhood’s picture will be less likely to get a divorce. Some sentences are very remarkable and meaningful.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>That speech wants to tell us to pursue perfection and fear no failure.He has some examples from his work. He once worked as a driver. That's all I can remember. Since failure in driving can cause irreparable damage, either money or people's life. He also showed on his ppt with a lot of data to tell the audience why we should seek perfection. By the way, I think he is a handsome speaker.     </paragraph>

			<paragraph>The talk mentioned that the problem with infectious diseases, as we all know, is that pathogens continue to evolve, and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy. And therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases. And he said the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha -- a mouthful. If anyone can find the link of it, It will be much helpful.</paragraph>
